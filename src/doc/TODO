See:

Simplify Endpoint considerably and make it RESTful in that sense.  So it should
still use POST and PUT separately (unlike $resource), but allow it to accept and
expose a $resource style prototype/constructor for resources, with a 'save'
method that automatically calls post/put as needed and stores back the ID of the
new item as received from the backend.
